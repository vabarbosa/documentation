    "\n",
    "The Qiskit patterns framework is a general procedure for approaching and solving problems with a quantum computer. It consists of four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mapping** our problem to quantum circuits and operators\n",
    "2. **Optimizing** the circuit for target hardware\n",
    "3. **Executing** on target hardware\n",
    "4. **Post-processing** our results\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate these steps, we will implement a *quantum* version of the half-adder circuit discussed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical adder circuit uses an XOR and an AND gate to calculate the sum and carry bits, respectively. We can adapt these gates to the quantum context to make the quantum half adder. First, remembering that quantum gates are *reversible*, we cannot simply overwrite the inputs. Instead, we introduce two helper qubits initialized to $\\vert 0\\rangle$ to store the sum and carry outputs. So, our full quantum state will consist of qubits $A$ and $B$, and the sum and carry qubits, which we'll label $S$ and $C$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vert \\psi\\rangle = \\vert C S B A\\rangle$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we need quantum gates that accomplish what the XOR and AND gates did in the classical circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sum:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the XOR, we apply two CNOTs, each with control qubits $A$ and $B$ and target qubit $S$ for both. If $A$ and $B$ are different, then one of the CNOT gates will flip $S$ to the $\\vert 1\\rangle$ state. If $A$ and $B$ are both $\\vert 0\\rangle$, then nothing happens to $S$ and it remains in the $\\vert 0\\rangle$ state. If $A$ and $B$ are both $\\vert 1\\rangle$, then the state of $S$ will flip twice, bringing it back to the $\\vert 0\\rangle$ state.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Carry:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the carry bit, we need something that works like the classical AND gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Check your understanding\n",

    "</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "__Answer:__\n",
    "\n",
    "It's the Toffoli gate! Remember, the Toffoli, or controlled-controlled-NOT gate, flips the target state if and only if control qubit 0 AND control qubit 1 are both $\\vert 1\\rangle$. So, if the target qubit starts in the state $\\vert 0\\rangle$, then it has the same action as the AND gate.\n",

    "Above is the circuit diagram for the quantum half-adder circuit. As mentioned previously, the wires represent qubits $0$ to $3$ ordered from top to bottom, and the classical bit register is the bottom double-lined wire. Then, reading from left to right, we see how the gates are applied to each qubit by seeing where the boxes show up on the corresponding wires. Finally, the measurements are shown at the end. The measurements collapse the qubit states into definite $0$ or $1$ values, and the results are sent to a classical register.\n",

    "\n",
    "Next, we need to optimize the circuit to be run on the quantum hardware. This optimization is accomplished through the transpiler, which translates the abstract circuit shown above into instructions that the quantum computer will understand. It assigns the logical qubits above to real, physical qubits on the processor and rewrites the gates in terms of its own native set of gates that have been optimized to run on the quantum computer. Finally, the transpiler also implements something called \"error suppression and mitigation\" to try to minimize the effect of errors on the result. This isn't so important for our very simple circuit, but if you continue in your quantum computing journey to run more complicated circuits, you will soon see the value of error suppression and mitigation. If you want to learn more about this, see Olivia Lane's course, [Quantum Computing in Practice](/learning/courses/quantum-computing-in-practice/introduction).\n",

Now you're ready to explore the other Qiskit in the Classroom modules!\n",

    "\n",
    "- In contrast to classical bits which can only take on values 0 and 1, qubits can also be in **superposition** states of both 0 and 1.\n",
    "- Multiple qubits can be in a superposition over the classically allowed bitstrings called **computational basis states**.\n",
    "- Multiple qubits can be **entangled** so that the state of one depends on the state of the other.\n",
    "- The Qiskit convention is to use **little-endian notation**, which places the least significant qubit, $q_0$, in the rightmost position and the most significant qubit, $q_N$, leftmost.\n",
    "- **Quantum gates** are reversible operations that are represented by unitary matrices which act on the quantum state vectors. In this notation, the matrix closest to the vector (which is furthest right) acts first.\n",
    "- **Measurements** collapse a quantum superposition state into one of its classically allowed states, with probability equal to the square of the amplitude of the corresponding computational basis state in the superposition.\n",
    "- Quantum circuits are often represented using **quantum circuit diagrams**, where qubits are depicted as horizontal wires, and quantum gates appear along these wires from left to right.\n",
    "- To run a quantum circuit, we use the four steps in the **Qiskit patterns** workflow: **Map**, **Optimize**, **Execute**, **Post-process**."
